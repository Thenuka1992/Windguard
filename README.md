This is a system to detect the anomalies in a forest like tree cutting, illegal cultivation inside forests. We used a quadcopter as our data source which will provide a video by travelling around the places defined and the video is then sliced in to set of images and sent to a centralized location. Through a web portal which enables access to forest department and police department it will give alerts and warnings of the areal map created by the images taken from the video
